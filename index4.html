Ali came riding by-the highest head<br>
Bent to the dust, o'ercharged with dread,<br>
   Whilst <q>God be praised! all cried;<br>
Aged and bent, who dared arrest<br>
   The pasha in his pride.</q></br>
        <br>
"Ali Tepelini, light of all light,</br>
Who hold'st the Divan's upper seat by right,</br>
   Whose fame Fame's trump hath burst-</br>
Thou art the master of unnumbered hosts,</br>
Shade of the Sultan-yet he only boasts</br>
   In thee a dog accurst!</br>
       <br>

"An unseen tomb-torch flickers on thy path,</br>
Whilst, as from vial full, thy spare-naught wrath</br>
   Splashes this trembling race:</br>
These are thy grass as thou their trenchant scythes</br>
Cleaving their neck as 'twere a willow withe-</br>
  Their blood none can efface.</br>
         <br>
"But ends thy tether! for Janina makes</center></br> A grave for thee where every turret quakes,</center></br>
And thou shalt drop below</center></br>
To where the spirits, to a tree enchained,</center></br>
Will clutch thee, there to be 'mid them retained</center></br>
   For all to-come in woe!</center></br>
<br>
"Or if, by happy chance, thy soul might flee</center></br>
Thy victims, after, thou shouldst surely see</center></br>
  And hear thy crimes relate;</center></br>
Streaked with the guileless gore drained from their veins,</center></br>
Greater in number than the reigns on reigns</center></br>
  Thou hopedst for thy state.</center></br>
<br>
"This so will be! and neither fleet nor fort</center></br>
Can stay or aid thee as the deathly port</center></br>
  Receives thy harried frame!</center></br>
Though, like the cunning Hebrew knave of old,</center></br>
To cheat the angel black, thou didst enfold</center></br>
  In altered guise thy name."</center></br>
<br>
Ali deemed anchorite or saint a pawn-</center></br>
The crater of his blunderbuss did yawn,</center></br>
   Sword, dagger hung at ease:</center></br>
But he had let the holy man revile,</center></br>
Though clouds o'erswept his brow; then, with a smile,</center></br>
   He tossed him his pelisse.</center></br>
