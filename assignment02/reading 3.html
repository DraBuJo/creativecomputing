        <h1>How does changing the typography of an iconic logotype such as Google, affect the way people think of the company, especially when drastic changes are being made?</h1>

<p>I still remember in 2003 when I first surfed on the internet, the traditional typeface Google was deeply imprinted in my heart. The typeface looked fragile and old-fashion. The icon color reminded me the pornographic website. But at that time, I trusted Yahoo search engine because Yahoo design looked more stable. I guessed the reason was the single color and iconic letter Y. I could say, 10 years ago the Google logo looked vulgar and untrustable.<br>
In recent years. The Google company has received a lot of attention. Of course, one of the reason is the new logo design. It is a little bit childish but it is mature than before. At least it is not pornographic. Before the five colors and traditional typeface are not suitable. But this time, geometric typeface is much better than before. And one single letter use only one color. Also, the animation is interesting. It change the stiff imagination like before. Definitely Google company has independent creativity and can produce some interested ideas.
