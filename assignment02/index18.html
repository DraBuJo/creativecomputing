        <br>
    li came riding by-the highest head</br>
     <br>Bent to the dust, o'ercharged with dread,</br>
        <br> Whilst "God be praised!" all cried;</br>
    <br> Aged and bent, who dared arrest</br>
         <br>The pasha in his pride.</br>

     <br>"Ali Tepelini, light of all light,</br>
     <br>Who hold'st the Divan's upper seat by right,</br>
        <br> Whose fame Fame's trump hath burst-</br>
     <br>Thou art the master of unnumbered hosts,</br>
     <br>Shade of the Sultan-yet he only boasts</br>
         In thee a dog accurst!</br>

    <br> "An unseen tomb-torch flickers on thy path,</br>
    <br> Whilst, as from vial full, thy spare-naught wrath</br>
         <br>Splashes this trembling race:</br>
    <br> These are thy grass as thou their trenchant scythes</br>
     <br>Cleaving their neck as 'twere a willow withe-</br>
         <br>Their blood none can efface.</br>

     <br>"But ends thy tether! for Janina makes</br>
     <br>A grave for thee where every turret quakes,</br>
         <br>And thou shalt drop below</br>
     <br>To where the spirits, to a tree enchained,</br>
     <br>Will clutch thee, there to be 'mid them retained</br>
         <br>For all to-come in woe!</br>

     <br>"Or if, by happy chance, thy soul might flee</br>
     <br>Thy victims, after, thou shouldst surely see</br>
         <br>And hear thy crimes relate;</br>
     <br>Streaked with the guileless gore drained from their veins,</br>
     <br>Greater in number than the reigns on reigns</br>
        <br> Thou hopedst for thy state.</br>

     <br>"This so will be! and neither fleet nor fort</br>
     <br>Can stay or aid thee as the deathly port</br>
         <br>Receives thy harried frame!</br>
     <br>Though, like the cunning Hebrew knave of old,</br>
     <br>To cheat the angel black, thou didst enfold</br>
         <br>In altered guise thy name."</br>

     <br>Ali deemed anchorite or saint a pawn-</br>
     <br>The crater of his blunderbuss did yawn,</br>
         <br>Sword, dagger hung at ease:</br>
    <br> But he had let the holy man revile,</br>
     <br>Though clouds o'erswept his brow; then, with a smile,</br>
         <br>He tossed him his pelisse.</br>
