            My journey everyday is definitely a triangle on the map. Basically,  three destinations: my apartment, school, and gym. And they are located in the different area in New York and New Jersey: I live in Jersey City, NJ. The school is located in NYC, and the gym is located in Edgewater, NJ.
            <br>
Of course, going to school is tough journey everyday. Even though the distance between my home and my apartment is just three miles. I still need to spend one solid hour on transportation. For example, I need to take the bus before I take pathway. The bus is start to wobble and makes me dizzy. The driver’s driving style is very brutal. Every morning they try to let me spit out my breakfast. The turely disaster is pathway. These pathways are always suspended without warning. And taking the pathway is very crowd. I feel like I become the bacon in the sandwich.
But I have another choice to go to school. I can drive my car to go to school. I like drive, but this is not a cheap way to go to school because parking in Manhattan is very expensive. Driving car is a pleasure. The time I spend on the car depends on my driving skill. And I have private space, which means I can do something else like smoking. But it is very very expensive, it is like blow my money.

Everyday I just have one class in school. So the time I spend in school is no more than three hours. And I come back to some, the feeling of transportation is same shit like how I go to school. The next destination is gym. Before I go to gym, I need to eat meal. I need a lot of protein because I exercise my muscles. The reason why I go to gym everyday because the school life is so boring. The good news is I have to drive my car to go to gym and it costs me around half hour to go to gym and another half hour to come back. I feel I drive a rocket rather than a car. I love driving.
<br>
I spend around 2-3 hours in the gym everyday. I would say doing exercises in gym is the best way to release the pressures. Surprisingly, I don’t have any feeling when I am doing exercises. It should be like the sense in the movie Rocky. But I don’t have the feeling that I am motivated. I just do them, like a robot. By the way, even though the distance between my apartment and gym is fifteen miles, I just need half hour to reach the destination. Good job pathway.
Living in NJ needs a calculation. Actually. I always calculate the cost of transportation and how much time I spend. So I show some cost of transportation everyday:<br>
    Taking bus one way:1.50-1.60 dollars 20-30 mins<br>
    Pathway one way: 2.75 dollars 20-30 mins<br>
    Driving car to go to school: 45-55 dollars per day 40-50 min for single way<br>
    Gas: 40 dollars per week<br>
