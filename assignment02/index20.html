    Ali came riding by-the highest head
     <span style="white-space: nowrap">Bent to the dust, o'ercharged with dread,</span>
         Whilst "God be praised!" all cried;
        Aged and bent, who dared arrest
         The pasha in his pride.

     "Ali Tepelini, light of all light,
     <span style="white-space: nowrap">Who hold'st the Divan's upper seat by right,</span>
         Whose fame Fame's trump hath burst-
     Thou art the master of unnumbered hosts,
     Shade of the Sultan-yet he only boasts
         In thee a dog accurst!

     "An unseen tomb-torch flickers on thy path,
    <span style="white-space: nowrap"> Whilst, as from vial full, thy spare-naught wrath</span>
         Splashes this trembling race:
    <span style="white-space: nowrap"> These are thy grass as thou their trenchant scythes</span>
     <span style="white-space: nowrap">Cleaving their neck as 'twere a willow withe-</span>
         Their blood none can efface.

     "But ends thy tether! for Janina makes
     <span style="white-space: nowrap">A grave for thee where every turret quakes,</span>
         And thou shalt drop below
     To where the spirits, to a tree enchained,
     <span style="white-space: nowrap">Will clutch thee, there to be 'mid them retained</span>
         For all to-come in woe!

     "Or if, by happy chance, thy soul might flee
     Thy victims, after, thou shouldst surely see
         And hear thy crimes relate;
     <span style="white-space: nowrap">Streaked with the guileless gore drained from their veins,</span>
     <span style="white-space: nowrap">Greater in number than the reigns on reigns</span>
         Thou hopedst for thy state.

     "This so will be! and neither fleet nor fort
     Can stay or aid thee as the deathly port
         Receives thy harried frame!
     <span style="white-space: nowrap">Though, like the cunning Hebrew knave of old,</span>
     To cheat the angel black, thou didst enfold
         In altered guise thy name."

     Ali deemed anchorite or saint a pawn-
     The crater of his blunderbuss did yawn,
         Sword, dagger hung at ease:
     But he had let the holy man revile,
     <span style="white-space: nowrap">Though clouds o'erswept his brow; then, with a smile,</span>
         He tossed him his pelisse.
