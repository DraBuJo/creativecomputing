<h3><center>Ali came riding by-the highest head</center></h3>
<p>
<center>Bent to the dust, o'ercharged with dread,
   <center>Whilst <q>God be praised! all cried;<br>
<center>Aged and bent, who dared arrest
   <center>The pasha in his pride.</q></br></center>

<h3><center>"Ali Tepelini, light of all light,</h3>
<p>
<center>Who hold'st the Divan's upper seat by right,
   <center>Whose fame Fame's trump hath burst-</br>
<center>Thou art the master of unnumbered hosts,</br>
<center>Shade of the Sultan-yet he only boasts
   <center>In thee a dog accurst!</br>

<h3><center>"An unseen tomb-torch flickers on thy path,</center></h3>
<p><center>Whilst, as from vial full, thy spare-naught wrath
   <center>Splashes this trembling race:</br>
<center>These are thy grass as thou their trenchant scythes</br>
<center>Cleaving their neck as 'twere a willow withe-
  <center>Their blood none can efface.</br></center></p>

<h3><center>"But ends thy tether! for Janina makes</center></h3> 
<p><center>A grave for thee where every turret quakes,</center>
<center>And thou shalt drop below</center>
<center>To where the spirits, to a tree enchained,</center>
<center>Will clutch thee, there to be 'mid them retained</center>
   <center>For all to-come in woe!</center>

<h3><center>"Or if, by happy chance, thy soul might flee</center></h3>
<p><center>Thy victims, after, thou shouldst surely see</center>
  <center>And hear thy crimes relate;</center>
<center>Streaked with the guileless gore drained from their veins,</center>
<center>Greater in number than the reigns on reigns</center>
  <center>Thou hopedst for thy state.</center>

<h3><center>"This so will be! and neither fleet nor fort</center></h3>
<p>
<center>Can stay or aid thee as the deathly port</center>
  <center>Receives thy harried frame!</center>
<center>Though, like the cunning Hebrew knave of old,</center>
<center>To cheat the angel black, thou didst enfold</center>
  <center>In altered guise thy name."</center>

<h1><center>Ali deemed anchorite or saint a pawn-</center></h1>
<p>
<center>The crater of his blunderbuss did yawn,</center>
   <center>Sword, dagger hung at ease:</center>
<center>But he had let the holy man revile,</center>
<center>Though clouds o'erswept his brow; then, with a smile,</center>
   <center>He tossed him his pelisse.</center>
